To Develop
-----------

A [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) library to store shared javascript business logic that can be used across any platform than can run JS.

Once you have those it's helpful to have these scripts installed globally

`npm install --global gulp typescript ts-node jshint`

From the root directory call `npm install` to install the remaining dependencies.

IDE
-----------

I recommend [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the `TSLint` plugin
