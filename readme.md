Installation
------

... are incomplete but here's some of it

You'll need installed:

+ nodejs
+ npm

Once you have those it's helpful to have these scripts installed globally

`npm install --global gulp typescript ts-node jshint`

From the root directory call `npm install` to install the remaining dependencies.

Gulp - File Watching

`gulp scripts` - To compile everything<br>
`gulp watch` - to compile on every file change
